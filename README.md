### 1.Basics:
Basic code to show how OOPs , Numpy , Pandas , Functions and Loops work in Python.

### 2. Library Managment System:
### Overview
The Library Management System is a console-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming principles.  
It models real-world entities such as books, users, and library operations.

### Features
- Add and manage books  
- Borrow and return books  
- User roles: Student and Librarian  
- Availability tracking  
- Modular class design

### OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Encapsulation** – private attributes for book details  
- **Inheritance** – Student and Librarian inherit from User  
- **Polymorphism** – role-specific behavior  
- **Abstraction** – library interface hides internal logic  
- **Decomposition** – separated into multiple modules

### 3. Student Grading System:
     ### Overview
This project focuses on algorithmic thinking and functional decomposition.  
It processes student marks and generates meaningful academic results.

### Features
- Add student records  
- Percentage and grade calculation  
- Search student (linear search)  
- Sort by performance  
- Class statistics (highest, lowest, average)

### Concepts Demonstrated
- Functions and modular design  
- Control flow (loops, conditions)  
- Data structures (lists, dictionaries)  
- Searching and sorting algorithms
